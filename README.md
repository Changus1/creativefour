Creative Lab #4

Main addition is the Admin Page, which can be accessed via the link within the Footer.

Changes: 
- Within the home page I integrated a back end server to house the Banner portion, so that the user can adjust the content. The banner is a random banner from the database, and it is set to a five second timer. 
- The pet of the day all uses a /api/animals/random endpoint to bring in a random animal each time you enter the page.

- The adopt and favorites page are also connected to a back end server.
